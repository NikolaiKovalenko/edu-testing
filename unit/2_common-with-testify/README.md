Let's consider another example to demonstrate how `testify` can be used with unit tests, focusing on a more complex data processing scenario.

### Example Scenario

Let's say we have a service that processes a list of orders and calculates the total price. We'll define an interface for the order processing, implement a simple order processor, and write unit tests using `testify` to validate its behavior.

#### Step 1: Define the Interface and Data Structures

#### Step 2: Implement the Order Processor

#### Step 3: Write the Unit Tests Using Testify

### Explanation

- **Data Structures**: The `Order` struct represents an order with `ID`, `Quantity`, and `Price`.
- **Interface Implementation**: The `SimpleOrderProcessor` implements the `OrderProcessor` interface, calculating the total price of valid orders.
- **Using Testify Assertions**:
    - `assert.Equal(t, expected, actual, msg...)`: Compares expected and actual values for equality.
    - `assert.EqualError(t, err, expectedErrorMsg, msg...)`: Verifies that an error matches the expected message.
    - `assert.NoError(t, err, msg...)`: Asserts that a function completes without error.
- **Test Cases**: The tests cover several scenarios:
    - Valid orders with expected total.
    - A case with no orders to trigger an error.
    - Orders with invalid details (negative quantity) to check error handling.

This example illustrates how testify's expressive assertions help focus on the intent of each test, making them clearer and easier to maintain.

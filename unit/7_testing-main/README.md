When you want to run integration tests (or tests that may require setup and teardown) in Go, you can leverage `testing.M`. This is particularly useful for initializing resources, such as database connections or mock servers, that need to be cleaned up after the tests run.

In the example below, weâ€™ll use `testing.M` to initialize the mock HTTP server that simulates external calls and performs all necessary setup before running our tests.

### Full Example With `testing.M`

Let's build on the previous example, implementing a simple user service while integrating it with `testing.M` for testing an HTTP handler in the `main` package.

#### Step 1: Define the User Repository Interface and User Service

This remains the same as illustrated previously.

#### Step 2: Create the Mock User Repository

Using `testify/mock` to mock the dependency:

#### Step 3: Create TestMain function with run of tests set, add setup and teardown behaviour

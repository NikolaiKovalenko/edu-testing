Unit testing is a fundamental practice in software development aimed at verifying that individual components or functions of code work as intended. Let's delve into the intricacies of unit testing, its principles, and the F.I.R.S.T guidelines.

### Overview of Unit Tests

#### **Purpose**

- Unit tests are designed to test the smallest parts of an application, typically functions, methods, or classes, in isolation from other parts of the codebase.
- The goal is to validate that each unit of the software performs its intended function correctly.

#### **Characteristics**

- **Isolation**: Unit tests are isolated from other parts of the application, including other tests, to ensure that they test only the intended functionality.
- **Mocking**: External dependencies like databases or network requests are mocked or stubbed to ensure the unit test is confined to the unit being tested.
- **Fast Execution**: Because unit tests only involve small pieces of code and their mocks, they execute rapidly, allowing developers to run tests frequently and get immediate feedback.
- **Repeatability**: Unit tests should yield the same results every time they are run, regardless of the test execution order or environment.

#### **Benefits**

- **Early Bug Detection**: By testing components in isolation, developers can identify issues sooner in the development cycle.
- **Documentation**: Unit tests can serve as a form of documentation, showing how individual components are expected to behave.
- **Refactoring Safety**: Having a robust suite of unit tests allows developers to refactor code confidently, knowing they can catch unintended changes in functionality.

### [F.I.R.S.T Principles for Unit Tests](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-testing/tree/main/unit/first)

The attributes that make a good unit test can be remembered with the acronym **F.I.R.S.T**:

1. **Fast**
    - Tests should run quickly to provide immediate feedback to developers. This encourages frequent execution and integration into the development process.

2. **Independent**
    - Each test should be independent of others, ensuring that tests can be run in any order without affecting their outcomes. Independence avoids side effects and shared state issues.

3. **Repeatable**
    - Tests should yield the same results regardless of where or how often they are run, even in different environments or on different machines.

4. **Self-Validating**
    - A unit test should automatically determine if the function being tested passes or fails. It should not require manual inspection of the output: the test result should be a clear pass or fail.

5. **Timely**
    - Ideally, tests should be written just before or during the development of the production code. Writing tests first (test-driven development, or TDD) can help clarify the intent of the code being written.

### Frameworks for Unit Testing
1. [**Testify - Thou Shalt Write Tests**](https://github.com/NikolaiKovalenko/edu-testing/tree/main/unit/TESTIFY.md)
   - Go code (golang) set of packages that provide many tools for testifying that your code will behave as you intend.
   
### Conclusion

Unit tests are an integral part of a robust testing strategy. By following the F.I.R.S.T principles, developers can write effective and efficient unit tests that provide quick feedback and improve the reliability of their software. As a best practice, incorporate unit testing consistently throughout the development process to catch bugs early and ensure code works as intended.
